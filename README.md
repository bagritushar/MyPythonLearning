## 📌 My Python & ML Learning Journey

This repository documents my 2-month journey of learning Python and Machine Learning, starting from the basics of Python programming to the fundamentals of Machine Learning.
The learning path is structured week by week, covering important concepts, practice programs, and mini-projects.

The goal of this repository is to:

Build strong Python foundations 🐍

Learn to use libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 📊

Explore Machine Learning basics 🤖

Work on beginner-friendly projects like House Price Prediction, Iris Classification, Titanic Survival 🚀
